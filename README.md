Project Overview
This project revolves around creating a smart robotic arm that can be controlled through a web interface using the ESP32 microcontroller.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic arm that can be manipulated remotely through a mobile device. This project combines hardware and software components to create an interactive and user-friendly system that allows users to control the arm's movements and perform tasks such as picking and placing objects. The robotic arm will utilize servos for precise movement, enabling it to mimic the functionality of a human arm.

Components Used
1.ESP32 Microcontroller: The heart of the robotic arm, the ESP32 provides Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing users to control the arm via a web interface.
  
2.Servos (Base, Shoulder, Elbow, Gripper): Four servos control the arm's movements, providing flexibility and precision in its actions.

3.Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows for intuitive control of the robotic arm.

4.Power Supply: A reliable power supply ensures that the servos receive adequate power to perform their functions smoothly.

Functionality
Web Control: Users can access the web interface through any device connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the ESP32. This interface features sliders to control the angles of each servo, allowing for real-time manipulation of the arm.
Recording and Playback: An exciting feature of this project is the ability to record a sequence of movements and play them back. This functionality can be beneficial for automating repetitive tasks or demonstrating the arm's capabilities.
Real-Time Feedback: The system provides real-time feedback on the position of the arm, enhancing the user experience and allowing for precise control.

User Interaction
The web interface is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring intuitive controls that make it accessible even for users with limited technical knowledge. Users can easily adjust the servos by dragging sliders on the interface, watching as the robotic arm responds to their commands. This interactivity not only makes the project enjoyable but also serves as a valuable educational tool for understanding robotics and programming.
