# Real-Time-Web-Controlled-Multi-DOF-Robotic-Arm-with-Motion-Recording-and-Playback-using-ESP32
This project showcases a web-controlled robotic arm that can be manipulated in real-time using an ESP32. With a user-friendly web interface, you can easily adjust the arm's movements through intuitive sliders, record sequences, and play them back whenever you want.
